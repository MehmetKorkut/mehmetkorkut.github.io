🏆 Overview
This project showcases my first Power BI dashboard, built with dynamic interactivity, clean visual hierarchy, and optimized data modeling using a star schema. The process involved transforming a large raw dataset into a structured model and designing an insightful dashboard to analyze sales data efficiently.

🛠 Data Transformation & Star Schema Modeling
📌 From Big Table to Optimized Model
Reference Tables Creation

Extracted dimensional tables (Dim_Customer, Dim_Product, Dim_Geography, Date) from the raw dataset.
Created a fact table (Fact_Sales) to store transactional data.
Removing Duplicates

Ensured unique values in dimension tables (e.g., unique Customer_ID in Dim_Customer).
Defining Relationships

Established primary and foreign keys for each table to form a star schema (Fact_Sales at the center).
Ensured relationships were one-to-many where applicable.

🎨 Building the Dashboard
🔹 Dashboard Structure
The dashboard follows a structured layout:

Filters & Slicers (State, Year, Segment)
KPIs (Total Sales, Avg Sales per Product)
Trends Over Time
Breakdown by Categories & Segments
Detailed Product-Level Insights

🎛 Enhancing Interactivity
Slicers (State, Year, Segment) are properly aligned and synced.
Interactivity between visuals (e.g., clicking a bar updates other charts).

🎨 Visual & UX Enhancements
✔️ Consistent color themes (matching category colors).
✔️ Data labels on bar/column charts.
✔️ Tooltips for additional insights.
✔️ KPIs prominently displayed with clear DAX-based calculations.

📊 Key Insights & Visuals
Top 5 Products by Sales
Sales Breakdown by Sub-Category (Treemap)
Customer Segment Analysis (Stacked Column Chart)

✅ Final Review & Testing
🔍 Tested slicers to ensure correct updates.
📈 Verified sales totals for accuracy.
👥 Reviewed with end-users for usability feedback.

🎯 Conclusion
This project was a great learning experience in data modeling, Power BI visuals, and interactivity. By structuring data efficiently and designing a clean, insightful dashboard, I gained hands-on experience in data storytelling.
