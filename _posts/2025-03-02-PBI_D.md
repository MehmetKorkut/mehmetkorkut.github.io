  <h2>🏆 Overview</h2>
  <p>This project showcases my first Power BI dashboard, built with dynamic interactivity, clean visual hierarchy, and optimized data modeling using a star schema. The process involved transforming a large raw dataset into a structured model and designing an insightful dashboard to analyze sales data efficiently.</p>

## 🛠 Data Transformation & Star Schema Modeling

### 📌 From Big Table to Optimized Model

#### Reference Tables Creation

- Extracted dimensional tables (Dim_Customer, Dim_Product, Dim_Geography, Date) from the raw dataset.
- Created a fact table (Fact_Sales) to store transactional data.

#### Removing Duplicates

- Ensured unique values in dimension tables (e.g., unique Customer_ID in Dim_Customer).

#### Defining Relationships

- Established primary and foreign keys for each table to form a star schema (Fact_Sales at the center).
- Ensured relationships were one-to-many where applicable.

## 🎨 Visual & UX Enhancements

✔️ Consistent color themes (matching category colors).  
✔️ Data labels on bar/column charts.  
✔️ Tooltips for additional insights.  
✔️ KPIs prominently displayed with clear DAX-based calculations.  

## 📊 Key Insights & Visuals

- **Top 5 Products by Sales**
- **Sales Breakdown by Sub-Category** *(Treemap)*
- **Customer Segment Analysis** *(Stacked Column Chart)*

## ✅ Final Review & Testing

- 🔍 Tested slicers to ensure correct updates.
- 📈 Verified sales totals for accuracy.
- 👥 Reviewed with end-users for usability feedback.
