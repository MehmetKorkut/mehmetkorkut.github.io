Abstract

One of the main aspects of climate change is temperature rise. It has a direct effect on
electricity consumption. This study investigates the relationship between electricity demand
and temperature in Nordic countries which are Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark. I use
daily data on electricity consumption from Nord Pool and mean temperature from countrys’
methodological institutes. I create 5 temperature intervals to analyze the relationship at each
interval. Post Double Selection method is used to analyze the impact. Results suggest that
temperature rise has a negative effect below 20°C whereas the effect turns to positive above
20°C. In addition, the strongest negative effect is seen between -10°C and 10°C due to intensity
of diminishing heating effect. This study contributes to the literature methodologically
