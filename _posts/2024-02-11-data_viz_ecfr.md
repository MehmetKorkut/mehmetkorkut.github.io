When I started learning Data Visualization for the first time in my third year in Bachelors degree, I was amazed by ggplot2 visuals. It was a informative 
piece of art for me. At the time, I was trying to make the most complex and good-looking data visualization I can do. However, then, I realized that it was
all about what you want to show and what your audience wants to see. At this point, data storytelling comes in. Coding complex models and showing the
performance in fancy visuals is amazing but what about the non-technical audience? I always thought using visualization packages or programs are must so that 
you can be a good data analyst/scientist. However, after years, I can totally say that it depends on the task. For example, you can use Python/R packages
for any visual or showing model assets. On the other hand, you can use Tableau or other program for bussiness problems. Then, what should I use for showing
data to general audience? The answer is Powerpoint. It sounds a bit odd to people like me who had a bias about it, but it is true. You can use Powerpoint
to make awesome fancy data visualizations. I realized this when I got trained by Addtwo Digital. I was amazed by how easily you can create a very different
looking data visual. (and it is looking amazing!)
If you read my bias breaking story, we can move to the project idea. I was reading 'A crisis of one’s own: The politics of trauma in Europe’s election 
year' article by Ivan Krastev and Mark Leonard. 
I checked all the survey data visualizations and thought about replacing some of them with some data visualizations I made in Powerpoint. The scenario is that
I am presenting the survey results to general audience in a big room and trying to make poeple spend time on the visual and think instead of presenting them
a table. Check some of my visuals below;
