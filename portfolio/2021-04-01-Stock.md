<h4>
Research question
</h4>
What are the impacts of COVID-19 on Stock Market and What will be the price movements in the future?
Motivation

2019-nCoV or Coronavirus was first seen on December 2019 in China. It did not cause panic at first, but dispersion got faster and faster all around the globe. World Health Organization named the coronavirus as Covi-19 on February 11 and declared global pandemic on March 11. Confirmed cases are over 20 million over the world

After the start of the pandemic, world economy started to suffer one of the worst economic crisis in the history. Stock market was hit hard when pandemic spread to Europe, then America continent. Stock market declined by 30 percent in overall by March.This is the sharpest decrease since the 2008 Mortgage Crisis. According to some economists, these reactions are evidence that stock markets are not fully efficient wheras other economists stated the difficulty of assessing the flow of information about pandemic and economic consequences. Raised concerns popped up the questions : How will stock markets recover? and What will be the movements of stock prices?
